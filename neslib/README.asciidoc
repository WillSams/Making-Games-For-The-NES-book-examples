Neslib
======

This is a ca65 asm library consisting of useful NES functions. It's designed to be
used with cc65 git master, no need for old runtimes or the like.

Credit for making this goes to Shiru, who published the original in public domain.

@clbr made some changes and fixed some things.

@sehugg made some more changes to integrate with http://8bitworkshop.com/
